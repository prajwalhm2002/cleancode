Issues:

Uses GetType() and typecasting (as) instead of polymorphism.

Violates Open/Closed Principle (OCP) â€“ Adding a new vehicle requires modifying this function.

Suggested Refactor (Use Polymorphism):

public interface IVehicle
{
    void TravelTo(Location location);
}

public class Bicycle : IVehicle
{
    public void TravelTo(Location location) => PeddleTo(location);
}

public class Car : IVehicle
{
    public void TravelTo(Location location) => DriveTo(location);
}

public Path TravelToTexas(IVehicle vehicle)
{
    vehicle.TravelTo(new Location("texas"));
}

More scalable and maintainable.
