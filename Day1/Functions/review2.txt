Issues:

Modifying the order's total directly (side effect).

Incorrect return type (void should return decimal).

Lack of validation (e.g., negative discounts).

Suggested Refactor:

public decimal ComputeDiscount(Order order, decimal discountAmount)
{
    if (discountAmount < 0)
        throw new ArgumentException("Discount cannot be negative");

    return order.Total - discountAmount;
}

More maintainable, avoids side effects, and includes validation.
